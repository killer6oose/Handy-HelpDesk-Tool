# Handy-HelpDesk-Tools
Assorted tools that are used on a helpdesk I worked for, all tools are open source

The first tool is a tool bar. Upon launching it'll go to the right side of the primary screen. 
Unfortunately, this tool works best with other items attatched: Active Directory, an asset tracking system, and a networked machine.


I'll be adding more tools to this list as need be
